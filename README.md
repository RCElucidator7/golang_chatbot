# Frank Reynolds chatbot!

This is my frank reynolds eliza chatbot! 
This chatbot was build for my third year project for Data Representation and Querying in GMIT. We had to build a simple chatbot in GoLang and give it a personality

# Whats Eliza?
ELIZA is an early natural language processing computer program created from 1964 to 1966 at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory by Joseph Weizenbaum.
It was created to demonstrate the superficiality of communication between man and machine, Eliza simulated conversation by using a 'pattern matching' and substitution methodology that gave users an illusion of understanding on the part of the program.
For more information go to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA

# How to Run
You can use this chatbot by cloning the current repository onto your own machiene.
You can then run the program by redirecting the command line to the current folder and typing the following into the terminal

	go run chatbot.go

The webpage is now served to the local host. To view the webapp , open the browser and enter this in the url bar

	localhost:8080

# Tips
If the conversation seems to be going nowhere, try using some key things to talk about like "Trash"
Also if you want to end the conversation, just say "Goodbye"!
